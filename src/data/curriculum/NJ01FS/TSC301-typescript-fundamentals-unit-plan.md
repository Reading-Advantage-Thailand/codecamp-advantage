# TSC301: TypeScript Fundamentals

## Unit Overview

This 5-day unit introduces students to TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Students will learn how TypeScript builds upon their existing JavaScript knowledge while adding static typing and other features to enhance code quality and maintainability. This unit continues the development of the Blog Application project, transitioning it to TypeScript and adding type safety.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Understand the benefits of TypeScript in Next.js projects
2. Use basic TypeScript types and type inference
3. Create and use interfaces and type aliases
4. Work with union types and type narrowing
5. Implement generics for flexible, reusable code
6. Configure TypeScript in a Next.js project
7. Refactor existing JavaScript code to TypeScript
8. Use TypeScript with React components and hooks

## Project Context

Students will enhance their Blog Application project by transitioning it to TypeScript. They will add type definitions to their existing components, implement new typed features, and leverage TypeScript's capabilities to catch potential errors early in the development process.

## Notes for LLM Instructor

- Emphasize how TypeScript builds upon students' existing JavaScript knowledge
- Encourage students to gradually adopt TypeScript features in their existing JavaScript code
- Stress the importance of TypeScript in large-scale applications and team environments
- Guide students through the process of thinking in terms of types and interfaces
- Be prepared to explain TypeScript's type inference capabilities and when to rely on them
- Encourage students to use TypeScript's language server features in their code editor
- Emphasize the benefits of catching errors at compile-time rather than runtime
- Be ready to provide additional resources for students who may struggle with static typing concepts
- Encourage peer code reviews to reinforce TypeScript best practices
- Remind students to apply TypeScript concepts to their Blog Application project incrementally
- Be prepared to discuss how TypeScript integrates with the broader JavaScript ecosystem
- Encourage students to explore popular TypeScript-first libraries and frameworks

Remember to consistently relate TypeScript concepts back to their practical application in Next.js development and the ongoing Blog Application project. Encourage students to view TypeScript as a powerful tool for creating more robust and maintainable web applications, especially in the context of larger, more complex projects they might encounter in their future careers.
