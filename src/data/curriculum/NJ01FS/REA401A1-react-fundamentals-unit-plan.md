# REA401A1: React Fundamentals for Next.js

## Unit Overview

This 10-day unit introduces students to React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with a focus on its use within Next.js applications. Students will learn core React concepts, including components, props, state, and hooks, while continuing to develop their Personal Portfolio project. By the end of this unit, students will be able to build dynamic, component-based web applications using React within the Next.js framework.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Understand the core concepts of React and its role in modern web development
2. Create and use functional React components
3. Manage component state using the useState hook
4. Handle side effects in components using the useEffect hook
5. Pass data between components using props
6. Implement basic routing in a Next.js application
7. Fetch and display data from APIs in React components
8. Manage global state using React Context
9. Optimize React components using useMemo and useCallback
10. Integrate third-party React libraries into a Next.js project

## Project Context

Students will continue working on their Personal Portfolio project, refactoring it to use React components within the Next.js framework. They will convert their existing HTML/CSS/JavaScript code into React components, implement dynamic routing, and add new interactive features using React hooks.

- Encourage students to practice creating small React applications alongside their portfolio project
- Stress the benefits of using functional components and hooks over class components
- Guide students through the transition from vanilla JavaScript to React's declarative style
- Be prepared to explain key differences between React in a standard setup vs. React in Next.js
- Encourage exploration of the React ecosystem and popular libraries
- Emphasize the importance of performance optimization and when to apply it
- Be ready to provide additional resources for students who may struggle with React concepts
- Encourage pair programming and code reviews to reinforce learning
- Remind students to incrementally apply React concepts to their portfolio project
- Be prepared to discuss how these React skills will be built upon in future units (e.g., more advanced Next.js features)
- Encourage students to explore the official React documentation and community resources for continued learning

Remember to consistently relate React concepts back to their practical application in web development and the ongoing Personal Portfolio project. Encourage students to view their growing React skills as a powerful tool for creating dynamic, efficient, and maintainable web applications.
