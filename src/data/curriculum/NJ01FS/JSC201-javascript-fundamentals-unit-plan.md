# JSC201: JavaScript Fundamentals

## Unit Overview

This 7-day unit introduces students to JavaScript, the programming language that brings interactivity to web applications. Students will learn core JavaScript concepts, syntax, and how to use JavaScript in the context of web development. This unit builds upon the HTML and CSS knowledge from previous units and continues the development of the Personal Portfolio project, adding dynamic features and interactivity.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Understand and use JavaScript syntax, data types, and basic constructs
2. Work with functions, including arrow functions and higher-order functions
3. Manipulate arrays and objects using built-in methods
4. Handle asynchronous operations using Promises and async/await
5. Utilize modern ES6+ features to write cleaner, more efficient code
6. Manipulate the DOM and handle events in web pages
7. Implement basic form validation and user interaction in their Personal Portfolio project

## Project Context

Students will enhance their Personal Portfolio project by adding JavaScript functionality. They will implement interactive features such as form validation, dynamic content loading, and simple animations. This will transform their static website into a more engaging and interactive web application.
