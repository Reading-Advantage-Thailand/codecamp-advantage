# DEV101A1: Development Environment Setup

## Unit Overview

This unit introduces students to the essential tools and practices for setting up a professional development environment for Next.js projects. Over three days, students will configure their local development environment, learn version control basics with Git and GitHub, and initialize their first Next.js project. This unit lays the foundation for the entire course and begins the Personal Portfolio project.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

1. Set up and customize Visual Studio Code for Next.js development
2. Understand and use basic Git commands for version control
3. Create and manage a GitHub repository
4. Install and use Node.js and npm to manage project dependencies
5. Initialize and understand the basic structure of a Next.js project
6. Begin development on a personal portfolio project using Next.js

## Project Context

Students will begin work on their Personal Portfolio project, which will be developed throughout the course. In this unit, they will set up the initial project structure and repository, serving as the foundation for future development.

## Notes for LLM Instructor

- Emphasize the importance of a consistent and efficient development environment
- Guide students through potential troubleshooting scenarios during setup
- Encourage best practices in Git usage and project organization from the start
- Stress the significance of documentation and clear communication in development projects
- Be prepared to explain the benefits of Next.js over traditional React setups
- Adapt explanations based on students' prior experience with web development tools
- For the optional Vercel deployment, provide clear instructions but don't require it for unit completion
- Be prepared to offer additional support for students who may struggle with initial setup
- Emphasize the importance of applying each new skill to the portfolio project as it's learned
- Encourage students to customize their portfolio beyond the basic setup, if they feel comfortable doing so
- Be prepared to troubleshoot common issues with Next.js project initialization and GitHub integration
- Remind students that the portfolio is a work in progress and will be developed throughout the course

Remember to consistently relate concepts back to their practical application in web development and the ongoing Personal Portfolio project.
