# HTML101: HTML and CSS Fundamentals

## Unit Overview

This 5-day unit introduces students to the fundamental building blocks of web development: HTML and CSS. Students will learn how to structure web content with HTML5 semantic elements, style it using modern CSS techniques, and create responsive layouts. This unit builds upon the development environment set up in the previous unit and continues the development of the Personal Portfolio project.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand and use HTML5 semantic elements to structure web content
2. Apply CSS styling to HTML elements using various selectors and properties
3. Implement responsive web design using CSS Flexbox and Grid
4. Utilize CSS Modules in a Next.js project for component-scoped styling
5. Understand the basics of Tailwind CSS and its utility-first approach
6. Create and style multiple pages for their Personal Portfolio project

## Project Context

Students will continue working on their Personal Portfolio project, focusing on creating the basic structure and styling. They will create multiple pages (e.g., Home, About, Projects) and implement a responsive layout using modern CSS techniques.
